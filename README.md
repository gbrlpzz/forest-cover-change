# forest-cover-change
A Google Earth Engine tool that detects land abandonment and forest dynamics from harmonized Landsat time-series (1985–2023). It maps open→forest recovery, forest→open loss, and estimates year of reforestation at 30 m resolution. Includes an interactive NDVI history inspector for validation and interpretation.
